# Packet Sniffer

The Packet Sniffer is a tool designed to capture and analyze network traffic, intercepting and inspecting packets for various purposes such as network troubleshooting, security monitoring, or protocol analysis.

## Introduction

Packet sniffing is the process of intercepting and logging network traffic passing through a computer network interface. The Packet Sniffer tool allows users to capture packets in real-time, providing insights into network activity, identifying security threats, and diagnosing network issues.

## Features

- **Live Packet Capture:** Capture and analyze network packets in real-time as they pass through the network interface.
- **Protocol Decoding:** Decode and interpret packet contents to understand the data exchanged between networked devices.
- **Filtering:** Apply filters to capture packets based on specific criteria, such as source or destination IP address, protocol type, or port number.
- **Packet Reconstruction:** Reassemble fragmented packets and reconstruct network conversations for analysis.
- **Exporting:** Export captured packets to common packet capture file formats for further analysis or archival purposes.
- **Stealth Mode:** Operate in stealth mode to avoid detection by network intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls.

## Usage

1. **Interface Selection:** Choose the network interface on which to capture packets.
2. **Filter Configuration:** Specify filters to capture packets based on specific criteria, if desired.
3. **Initiate Capture:** Start the packet capture process to begin intercepting and logging network traffic.
4. **Analysis:** Analyze captured packets using built-in tools or export them to external packet analysis tools for further examination.
5. **Troubleshooting:** Use captured packet data to diagnose network issues, identify performance bottlenecks, or detect security threats.

## Warning

Packet sniffing can potentially intercept sensitive information, including passwords, usernames, and other confidential data. It is important to obtain proper authorization before conducting packet sniffing activities, especially on networks or systems that you do not own or administer.
